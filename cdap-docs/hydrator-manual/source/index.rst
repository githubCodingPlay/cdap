.. topic:: Annotation System

  *To review this document, an annotation system is running on a server in our cloud.*

  *To add an annotation, select some text, click the popup-button, and enter your comment
  in the window.*

  *Enter your name, handle, or initials as a tag.*

  *Ignore the checkboxes (and the bug that causes them to be duplicated!) as the auth
  system is disabled.*

  *Annotations are saved using the URL, and so will not appear on subsequent builds in the
  same branch, which is as-intended.*
