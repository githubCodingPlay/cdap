This section is intended for developers writing custom plugins. Users of plugins and
pipelines should refer to the documentation on :ref:`using plugins
<cask-hydrator-introduction-what-is-a-plugin>`.

CDAP provides for the creation of custom plugins to extend the existing
``cdap-data-pipeline`` and ``cdap-etl-realtime`` system artifacts.

**Note:** The ``cdap-etl-batch`` artifact has been deprecated and replaced with the
``cdap-data-pipeline``, as of CDAP 3.5.0.

Deploying plugins is covered under :ref:`Plugin Deployment:
<cask-hydrator-plugin-management-deployment>`, for deploying as either a system or user
artifact.
