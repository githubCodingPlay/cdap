.. rubric:: Description

A system-supplied validator that offers a set of functions that can be called from the Validator transform.

It is included in a transform by adding its name (``core``) to the ``validators`` field of
the transform configuration and its functions are referenced by using its JavaScript name
(``coreValidator``). See an example in the Validator transforms plugin, either for
`batch <../batch/transforms/validator.html>`__ or `real-time <../realtime/transforms/validator.html>`__.

.. rubric:: Use Case
