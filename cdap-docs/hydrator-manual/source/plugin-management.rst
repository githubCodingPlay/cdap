Plugin Management

.. NOTE: Because of the included files in this file, use these levels for headlines/titles:
  .. one   -----
  .. two   .....
  .. three `````
  .. etc.

To **package, present,** and **deploy** your plugin, see these instructions:

- `Plugin Packaging: <#plugin-packaging>`__ packaging in a JAR
- `Plugin Presentation: <#plugin-presentation>`__ controlling how your plugin appears in the Hydrator Studio
- `Plugin Deployment: <#deploying-a-system-artifact>`__ deploying as either a system or user *artifact*
- `Deployment Verification: <#deployment-verification>`__ verifying an artifact was added successfully

If you are installing a **third-party JAR** (such as a **JDBC driver**) to make it accessible to other
plugins or applications, see :ref:`these instructions <cask-hydrator-third-party-plugins>`.

Deploying Third-Party JARs
==========================

.. highlight:: json  

**Prebuilt JARs:** In a case where you'd like to use pre-built third-party JARs (such as a
JDBC driver) as a plugin, you will need to create a JSON file to describe the JAR.

For information on the format of the JSON, please refer to the sections on
:ref:`Third-Party Plugins <plugins-third-party>` and :ref:`Plugin Deployment <plugins-deployment>`.

A sample JDBC Driver Plugin configuration:

.. container:: highlight

  .. parsed-literal::
  
    {
      "parents": [ "cdap-etl-batch[|version|,\ |version|]" ],
      "plugins": [
        {
          "name" : "mysql",
          "type" : "jdbc",
          "className" : "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver",
          "description" : "Plugin for MySQL JDBC driver"
        },
        {
          "name" : "postgresql",
          "type" : "jdbc",
          "className" : "org.postgresql.Driver",
          "description" : "Plugin for PostgreSQL JDBC driver"
        }
      ]
    }


Managing Multiple Versions
==========================
To Be Completed


Deleting Plugins
================
Plugins can be deleted using either the :ref:`Artifact HTTP RESTful API <http-restful-api>` or
the :ref:`CDAP CLI <cdap-cli>`.

In the case of the CDAP CLI, only plugins that have been deployed in the ``user`` scope
can be deleted by the CDAP CLI. Both ``system`` and ``user`` scope plugins can be deleted
using the HTTP RESTful API by using the appropriate calls.

Note that in all cases, the actual files (JARs and JSON files) associated with the plugins
are not deleted. Instead, the references to them are deleted in the CDAP system. If the
files are not removed after these references are deleted, then |---| in the case of the
``system`` scope plugins |---|, the artifacts will be reloaded the next time CDAP is
restarted, as they are automatically loaded at startup from the `appropriate directory
<plugin-management#deploying-as-a-system-artifact>`_.
